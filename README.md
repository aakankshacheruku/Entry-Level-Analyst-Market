# Entry-Level-Analyst-Market

I'm rebuilding this project to understand how the entry-level data analyst job market actually looks — and why it has felt difficult lately. I'm combining public datasets from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (JOLTS + CPS) with a small sample of real job postings to measure demand, hiring, and “experience inflation” for early-career analysts. The pipeline pulls public data with Python, models it in DuckDB/SQL, and exports clean tables for dashboards.

## Reboot Plan (October 2025)
- [x] Project scaffolding and README refresh
- [ ] BLS data ingestion (JOLTS openings + hires)
- [ ] SQL model (Hires per Opening, rolling, YoY)
- [ ] Testing and QA
- [ ] Tableau export
- [ ] Entry-Level Inflation notes (postings sampling)

## Project Goal
To provide an honest, data-backed picture of how opportunities for new analysts are shifting — by combining hiring data, labor statistics, and live job requirements into one transparent dataset and dashboard.
